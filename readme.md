# AWS Data Pipeline Project

Welcome to the AWS Data Pipeline Project! This project is designed to create an automated data pipeline on the cloud using Python and MySQL on AWS, incorporating services like RDS, Lambda, and CloudWatch.

## Project Overview
This exercise focuses on collecting vital information about the geographic location and population size of specific cities in Germany. Utilizing web scraping techniques on Wikipedia.org, the project goes beyond and fetches real-time weather data and details on arriving flights for the next day (CET). All the gathered data is stored in a relational database, organized into tables like cities, airports, population, weather, and flights.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary tools:

- API keys for the Weather API (5-day forecast) and AeroDataBox.
  - Free options with monthly limited requests are available for both APIs.
